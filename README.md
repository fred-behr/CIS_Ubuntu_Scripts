# CIS Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS Benchmark

## Introduction

Based on the "CIS Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS Benchmark", this repository has scripts for setting up Ubuntu in the recommended way, according to CIS.

CIS recommends that 6 configurations are set in Ubuntu to make it safer to use. This repository's scripts implements them.

## Why does this repository exist?

This is due to the following:

- These scripts installs each of the 6 configurations automatically.
- No need to manually do it.
- Overview of the configurations.
- The setup's commands can be quite lengthy and containing special characters, which in itself is not so bad, but the OS can have a hard time mapping your keyboard, so that you can type the characters like normal.
- Scripts will make it easier to set Ubuntu up according to CIS, rather than going through the lengthy PDF, they've made.

## Requirements

The following is expected to ensure it works:

- Fresh install (or close) of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Internet access.
    - There will be a need to use apt install `apt install`
